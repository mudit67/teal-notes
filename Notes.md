<details>
<summary>
Why use tailwind?
(even though it will make the code look to complex and is hard to learn)
</summary>

- It would help us eliminate repetitive code.
- I might learn something new.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why use Typescript?</summary>

- The main reason is that the documentation for nextjs is mainly in typescript.
- It's just a better language and in the long run good to use.

make animate thing for the mouse pointer when it comes into the side bar. Inside the sidebar it will have a little translucent circle around it. when it hover over a link the circle would disolve into a border and a background colour of the link

also going to add animate on scroll to /about and /contact route
maybe even to homepage featured blogs might have the same.
