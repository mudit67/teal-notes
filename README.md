# Blog Site

The idea is to create a blog site where i would publish blogs/ideas/posts on a regular basis(Preferbally Daily).  
  
These blogs can range from deep philosical thoughts to just fictional comedic stories that I created in my head.  
  
 Trying to create a better addiciton  
 (note to self: write a blog post about this)  
   
  ### Freatures
+ (Obviously) to write basic text blogs should have atleast .md level text formating
+ Comments and threads (heirarchial design structures)
+ This would be single creator/writer type web app. guests are allowed, but comments and discussion would require login, would consider to have a system like tim.blog has or any other site(need to research more).
+ extended blog writing features
	- images  
	- Dropdowns (to hide certain text and create a cleaner UI and reading experience)  
	-  Embeds like youtube, PDf , etc.  
+ there would be Category (single select) Tags (Multi Select) and Desciptive Tags as attributes for the blogs. Preferbaly add TL;DR also. (Some metadata like posted at,posted by)
+ Search by title  
+ Advance Search (search through tags, catergoies, discriptive tags etc.)
+ nested blogs (so the veiwer can go down,up ,left and right in the blogs hierarchy for some blogs)
+ In desktop veiw side Navbar would have nested breadcrubs for navigation for nest blogs

### Dev Notes
